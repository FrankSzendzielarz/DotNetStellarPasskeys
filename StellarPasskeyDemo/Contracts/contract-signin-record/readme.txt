This contract is an example contract showing a simple use case of making a public record of
the sign in id and the time. This contract is to illustrate
how you could use the passkey contract to authorise an operation. For example, a video game
development studio could use the same contract to implement an asset trading marketplace for
every game they produce, and use the same sign and asset ownership infrastructure in all their games.

A crucial takeaway is that for the particular user, which may be anonymous, the Stellar system
can be used as both a database and a transaction processing system where all the information is immutable,
highly secure, permanent and transparent. For example, if your system needed to process public polls,
or supply chain tracking, public quality control logging, and so on, Stellar would be a perfect choice, whereas
for anonymous data (such as the video game example) the public record facilitates dispute resolution or
other use cases.
